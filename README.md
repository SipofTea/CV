## Else Meijerink

I am a budding **Full Stack Junior Developer**, starting out my journey at Maker's Academy Developer Bootcamp. I'm a puzzle solver, I love to research and fix problems.

I started out in Biomedical Science, but soon found the lab work was repetitive and not creative enough for me. So I switched to Archaeology, but among other things it doesn't help people or fix any problems. So I decided to give writing code a try, and it's been really fun to learn and make things.

After graduating from Maker's I hope to find a role in a company where I can make a difference, and create something that will help people.

## Skills

#### Problem solver

In any project I work on I want to solve problems and solve them well. This means I like to find the root of the problem and change it for future cases as well, rather than fix each case as it comes along. From my LQA testing I have several examples of this.

  The first is that for some projects text was automatically translated using the same words a previous translation used. When translations are specific, this can lead to very odd outcomes. Rather than only changing the new string, I would make sure all occurrences were changed to something suitable so it wouldn't happen again. This brought down the number of recurring issues, saving time for new issues to be found and solved.
  
  Another example is new testers needing to ask the same questions. Whilst working remotely I discovered answering each question individually was very inefficient, so I took the initiative to write a guide with answers to common questions relating to Dutch testing. This lowered the pressure on me and other more senior colleagues, so we had more time to focus on our own work or more complex questions.

#### Team Player

I enjoy helping and supporting others. When someone asks a question or needs help I will always try to help to the best of my abilities, and not wait for others to respond first. Whether I'm helping colleagues at work, a coursemate, a friend, or just my mom with her phone, I'm always there to lend a hand. Whilst I enjoy working independently, I love hearing ideas from other people, and the creativity and insight that comes from collaborative problem solving. At Maker's, I'm learning a lot about pairing. I am improving my skills and knowledge when it comes to pairing and other forms of collaboration so I can be a good partner.
